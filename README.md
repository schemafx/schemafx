# SchemaFX

Build Without Boundaries. SchemaFX is an open-source, no-code platform designed to empower both developers and citizen developers. Unlike closed, proprietary tools, SchemaFX is built to be **fast, secure, transparent, and truly yours** — putting **data ownership and privacy** first.

### 📦 Installing

```Bash
npm install schemafx
```

### ⚙️ Customizing

```TS
import SchemaFX from 'schemafx';

new SchemaFX({
    dbOptions: { /* ... */ },
    fastifyOptions: { /* ... */},
    connectors: [ /* ... */ ],
    secret: ''
})
```

## ✨ Vision

SchemaFX is more than software—it’s a movement toward openness, speed, and ownership.
We believe that the future of no-code is transparent, community-driven, and free from lock-in.

## 🌱 Build in Public

SchemaFX isn’t just a product—it’s a community journey. The project is being developed transparently through a build-in-public approach:

- 📝 Weekly "diary mode" blog posts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mushasterion/list/schemafx-bdefa793d77f).
- 🎯 Sharing wins, struggles, and lessons learned.
- 🤝 Inviting contributors, early adopters, and collaborators.

## 🎯 Who Is SchemaFX For?

- Developers – Get a performant, open, and flexible platform to build on.
- Citizen Developers – Build apps without coding, while retaining data ownership.
- Businesses – Reduce costs, avoid lock-in, and maintain full control of data.
