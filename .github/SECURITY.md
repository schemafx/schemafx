# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The SchemaFX project takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and community members who help us identify and address these issues.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in SchemaFX, please report it to us as soon as possible via private email. Do not create a public GitHub issue, as this could expose the vulnerability to malicious actors.

Please send your report to: security@schemafx.com

When you submit your report, please include:

-   A clear and detailed description of the vulnerability.
-   The steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
-   The affected version of SchemaFX (if known).
-   Any proof-of-concept code or exploits.

## Our Commitment

We are committed to a timely and professional response to all vulnerability reports.

-   **Acknowledgment:** We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
-   **Investigation:** We will investigate the reported vulnerability promptly and provide you with an estimated timeline for a fix.
-   **Disclosure:** We will coordinate with you on the public disclosure of the vulnerability after a patch has been released. We believe in responsible disclosure and ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until a fix is available.

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

By reporting a vulnerability, you agree to the following terms:

-   You will not make the vulnerability public until it has been patched.
-   You will not exploit the vulnerability for personal gain or to access unauthorized data.
-   You will not engage in any activity that could disrupt our services or compromise the data of our users.

Thank you for helping us make SchemaFX a more secure platform for everyone.
